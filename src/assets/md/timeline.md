## 2024 Dec. Onwards
* Break from job searching to take care of old dog
    - My old friend is dying, and I'd like to spend time with him.
    - My sleep schedule is messed up because of this (need to care for him during the night).
    - Unlikely to find a job that aligns with my current schedule.
    - Thought I found one, but a client never responded, so no work. Done looking for now.
* Searching for later opportunities
    - Looking at e.g. PhD Scholarships later in the year
    - If you have job offers starting later (past August) in the year, I'd love to hear!

## 2024, June - Dec.
* Job Searching
    - I looked for a job, preferring ones in Canada or the UK.
    - Even now, please contact me if you think we can work together!

## 2023, June - 2024, June
