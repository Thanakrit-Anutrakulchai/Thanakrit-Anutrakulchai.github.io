                        I was born in Khon Kaen, Thailand. As per Thai tradition, my mother
                        gave me a nickname of 'New', standing for the 'new millenium,' since
                        I was born in the year 2000. That is the name I prefer to be called by in 
                        English; if we work together, please refer to me as 'New', and don't worry 
                        about pronouncing my first name!

                        I am a University of Edinburgh alumnus with a BSc. Honours degree in Computer
                        Science and Mathematics. Being fortunate enough to travel the world, I also
                        studied abroad in BC, Canada during highschool.

                        As for the other side of my degree, my maths interests mostly lie in 
                        compositional descriptions of structures and systems of classification.
                        Some related courses I took 
                        were <a href={GROUP_THEORY_WIKI_LINK}>

                        I took. In addition, I also self-studied basic

                        and used it implicitly in my undergraduate dissertation. 
                        Other than that... I also enjoy a nice jog.
